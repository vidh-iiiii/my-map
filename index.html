I still prefer the cold coffee though.",

After a dull batch photograph, we went off to eat some pizza and you held open the gate for me, my handsome gentleman. You actually got out of the car to pluck flowers for me and I couldn't believe this sort of romance novel fantasy was happening to me. This day is so special to me because its the first time we held hands, something that we do constantly now. I was blushing so much I couldn't meet your eyes. So, I just stared out the window, at the beautiful sunset, feeling the current inside me. I knew it was the start of something.",
